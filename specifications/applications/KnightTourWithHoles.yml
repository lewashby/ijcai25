    Problem description:
    Find a tour for the knight piece that starts at any square, travels all squares but the forbidden ones (representing holes on the board), and comes back to the origin, following the rules of chess.
    
    Format description of the predicates to be extracted:
    The input file contains one atom size(N), which states that the chess board size is N*N and a number of atoms forbidden(X1,Y1). 
    The rows of the board are numbered 1, 2, and so on up to N from top to bottom, and the columns are numbered 1, 2, and so on up to N from left to right. 
    Each square can thus be represented by a unique pair of coordinates.
- size(value): |
    value is the chess board size (an integer).
- forbidden(x,y): |
    List all the forbidden positions (or holes) by providing their coordinates (x,y).
    Coordinates are integers.
