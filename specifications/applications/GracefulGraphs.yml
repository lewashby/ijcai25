    Problem description:
    A graph (V,E) is called a graceful graph if its vertices V can be labelled with distinct integers from 0 to |E| such that, when each edge is labelled with the absolute difference between its vertex labels, the resulting edge labels are all distinct. The task is to determine the existence of a graceful labelling of a graph.
    
    Format description of the predicates to be extracted:
    The edges of the graph are provided by instances of the predicate edge/2.
- edge(source, target): |
    List all the edges from source (an integer) to target (an integer).
