    Problem description:
    A still life is a set of connected live cells from a grid that is fixed under the transition function of John Horton Conway 1970's Game of Life:
    1. Any cell with 3 neighbours becomes a live cell. 
    2. Any live cell with 2-3 live neighbours lives on. 
    3. Any live cell with <2 or >3 live neighbours dies. 
    
    The Connected Maximum-density Still Life problem is the task of fitting a given region of the grid with a maximally dense still life, i.e., a maximum number of live cells. (Most work has only looked at pseudo still lifes where the connectedness criterion is dropped.)
    
    Format description of the predicates to be extracted:
    We here consider square shaped regions. 
    The size n of the region is provided by an instance of the predicate size/1. 
    Cells connect horizontally, vertically, and diagonally.
- size(value): |
    value is the size of the region (an integer).
