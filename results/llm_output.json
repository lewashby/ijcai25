Unfortunately this step is NP-hard for even two layers (k = 2) where the ordering on one layer is given. Thus, research has focussed on developing heuristics to solve it. In practice the approach is to iterate through the levels, re-ordering the nodes on each level using heuristic techniques such as the barycentric method. Recently it was shown that modern optimization technology can tackle the complete k-level crossing minimization problem at least for small to medium sized graphs, generating optimal crossings.\n\nA crossing in a graph occurs if there are:\n1. nodes N1, N2 on layer i, and\n2. nodes N3, N4 on layer j, (j <> i), and\n3. edges e1 = (N1,N3), e2 = (N2,N4), and\n4. the position of N1 is antecedent of the position of N2, and\n5. the position of N4 is antecedent of the position of N3.```\nGiven the following specification for the predicates format: \n```The predicates layers/1 and in_layer/2 give the partitioning of nodes into layers.

data, and your task is to parse it into datalog facts."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Given the following problem description between triple backtips: \n ```In this domain, a reasoner keeps a schedule updated with respect to the addition of jobs and to equipment going offline.\nAll numerical quantities discussed below are integers. The largest possible value is specified by relation max_value(mv).\nList of devices\nEach device has one or more identical instances. Each instance may be offline, meaning that it cannot be used for scheduling.\nList of jobs\nFor each job, the following are specified:\n- Job's device, i.e. which device should be used for the job (REQUIRED).\n- Length, i.e. how long production of the job will take (REQUIRED).\n- Deadline, i.e. the job's latest end time (OPTIONAL).\n- Importance: an integer imp >= 1 (OPTIONAL, DEFAULTS TO 1).\n- A list of jobs that precede it, i.e. must be completely executed before the current job can start.\n\nA job is tardy if it is completed after its deadline. Its tardiness is computed as the difference between the job's actual end time and its deadline. The penalty for a job being tardy is computed as td * imp, where td is the job's tardiness and imp is the job's importance. NOTE: For jobs that don't have a deadline tardiness is intended as undefined; and since the penalty is tardiness * importance, the penalty of jobs without a deadline is undefined as well.\n\nMaximum total penalty\nThe total penalty of a schedule is the sum of the penalties of the single jobs. Schedules with a higher total penalty greater than the specified maximum total penalty are not valid solutions.\nCurrent schedule\nThe current schedule, which must be updated by the scheduler, specifies, FOR A SUBSET OF THE AVAILABLE JOBS, each job's start time and the device instance the job must be run on. Intuitively, elements of the list of jobs (see section above) that have no start time and device instance assigned in the current schedule should be viewed as jobs that have been added after the current schedule was computed.\nCurrent time\nThe current time ct is an integer specifying at which point the execution of the schedule is. Jobs whose end time is smaller than OR EQUAL TO ct are expected to have already been completed.\nThe scheduling task\nGiven the list of devices, the list of jobs, the current schedule, and the current time, the scheduler is expected to find a new schedule such that:\n- the start time and allocated instance of a job that has already been completed remain the same;\n- the start time and allocated instance of a job that is currently being executed on a device instance which is online remain the same;\n- jobs whose expected end time is greater than the current time cannot be scheduled on a device instance that is offline;\n- precedences between jobs are respected;\n- the total penalty is no larger than the maximum total penalty.\nRescheduling a job\nWhenever a job needs to be re-scheduled after it has already started, the scheduler will need to re-schedule the complete job, i.e. it will discard the part of the job that has already performed. The output of the scheduler should indicate that the job has been re-scheduled.```\nGiven the following specification for the predicates format: \n```max_value(<mv>): maximum possible value for the numerical quantities\n\ndevice(<d>): d is a device\ninstances(<d>,<n>): device d has n instances\noffline_instance(<d>,<i>): instance 1 <= i <= n is offline\n\njob(<j>): j is a job\njob_device(<j>,<d>): j must be executed by device d\njob_len(<j>,<l>): the amount of time needed to perform j is l, where l is an integer\ndeadline(<j>,<dl>): the deadline of j is dl\nimportance(<j>,<imp>): the importance of j is imp >= 1\nprecedes(<j1>,<j2>): the end time of j1 must precede (be less than or equal to) the start time of j2\n\nmax_total_penalty(<mp>): the total penalty of the schedule must be less than or equal to mp.\n\ncurr_job_start(<j>,<st>): the start time of j in the current schedule is st\ncurr_on_instance(<j>,<i>): in the current schedule, j is scheduled to run on device instance i\n\ncurr_time(<ct>): the current time is ct```\nExtract the datalog facts from this text: \n```Job 106 should end before 107 starts.

(Note that there always is a path to a field the avatar already resides on.)\n- There is a unique starting and a unique goal field in the labyrinth.\n- A solution is represented by pushes of the labyrinth's rows and columns such that the avatar can from its starting field (which changes its location when pushed) reach the goal field (which also changes its location when pushed) by a move along some path after each push.\n- There is a maximum number of pushes, and the avatar must be able to reach the goal field (which can be relocated by pushes) by moving along some path after each push.\nThe proposed variant of the Labyrinth game is a hard (presumably NP-complete) search problem.```\nGiven the following specification for the predicates format: \n```The fields of a quadratic NxN-labyrinth are provided by instances of predicate \"field\" as follows:\nfield(1,1). field(1,2). ... field(1,N). field(2,1). field(2,2). ... field(2,N). ... field(N,1). field(N,2). ... field(N,N).\n\nThe starting and the goal field are specified by exactly one instance of \"init_on\" and exactly one instance of \"goal_on\":\ninit_on(x_i,y_i). goal_on(x_g,y_g).\n\nIt always holds that 1 \u2264 x_i,y_i,x_g,y_g \u2264 N.\nThe connections of fields are given by instances of \"connect\" looking as follows: connect(x,y,d).\n\nAgain, we have 1 \u2264 x,y \u2264 N.

While heuristic search, mostly based on relaxation heuristics, is currently the superior method for most varieties of planning, its ability to solve critically resource-constrained problems is limited: relaxation heuristics basically ignore the resource consumption by actions. Nomystery is a nice test domain to study the behavior of planning algorithms in planning problems with resources.\nIn Nomystery, a truck moves in a weighted graph where a set of packages must be transported between nodes. Actions move the truck along edges and load/unload packages. Each move consumes the edge weight in fuel. The edge weights are uniformly drawn between 1 and an integer W. The initial fuel supply is set to C * M where M is the minimum required amount of fuel, calculated using a domain-specific optimal solver, and C >= 1 is a (float) input parameter that denotes the ratio between the available fuel vs. the minimum amount required. The closer C to 1, the more constrained the problem. If C=1only the optimal plan solves the problem.\nThe authors originally provided two versions of the domain, called Hard and Hard-cost. They differ only in the cost of the actions. In the first one, all the actions have unitary cost, while in the second version the cost of moving a track equals the fuel consumed. According to the author:\nIn the Hard encoding, problems with 12 locations and 12 packages become quite challenging for state-of-the-art planners when C is close to 1 [2]. Hard-cost encoding makes the problems easier for the current planners. The reason is that the heuristic functions that consider costs are not any more completely ignorant to the resource consumption of actions. However, this type of encoding is not always feasible for resource planning; there might be several resources and the cost of the plan might be different from the amount of the resource consumption. However, our initial experiments show problems in this encoding with 12 locations and 15 packages become challenging for current planners when C is close to 1.\nFrom the two versions of the domain only the Hard one (where cost of the plan and resource consumption are not related) has been considered at IPC 2011 (Deterministic Track). As the domain creator said, this was the most difficult one of the two formulations for planning systems. We retained the Hard version of the problem for the ASP Competition 2013.

A generic Urban Hydraulic Network can be modelled as an indirect and weighted graph: the nodes represent the junctions of the pipes (junction/1), and the edges represent the pipes. The two arguments of predicate pipe/2 are the two junctions connected by the pipe. The third argument of dem/3 is the weight associated to the pipe defined by the first two arguments, and represents the water demand delivered by the pipe (i.e., the average water demand, in litres/seconds, of the houses that take water from that pipe). One or more tanks feed the network; the tanks are located on the junction nodes given by predicate tank/1.\n\nIn order to permit the maintenance of any pipe, each pipe must be isolable. The isolation of a pipe can be performed by closing a set of \"isolation valves\". In any solution, for every pipe there must exist a set of valves that, when closed, disconnects that pipe from all the tanks.\n\nValves can only be located on the pipes near one extreme (i.e., near a junction), thus in general there can be at most two valves in a pipe. However, in some instances, the number of valves per pipe can be at most 1. The maximum number of valves in a pipe is given by predicate valves_per_pipe/1 (as said, it can be either 1 or 2).\n\nDue to the limited number of available valves, when a pipe is isolated for maintenance, other pipes become isolated as well: all those pipes that are no longer reachable from one of the tanks. This gives a disruption in the service of water delivery. The measure of disruption (given some isolation) is the total amount of water that is not delivered, given as the sum of the weights on the edges that are unreachable from all tanks. The general measure of disruption is the disruption in the worst case, and the aim is to minimize such a quantity.", "format": "The input predicates are explained as follows:\n\njunction/1: the nodes represent the junctions of the pipes\npipe/2: The two arguments are the two junctions connected by the pipe\ndem/3: The third argument is the weight associated to the pipe defined by the first two arguments, and represents the water demand delivered by the pipe\ntank/1: Represent a tank, the tanks are located on the junction nodes given by the first parameter\nvalves_per_pipe/1: Represents the maximum number of valves in a pipe\nvalves_number/1: Represents the number of valves", "text": "The junctions 12 and 17 are connected by the pipe, with a water demand of 94.
